            <p>Since 2004, I've created in-room entertainment and smart TV interfaces for many of the top hotel brands in Australia and worldwide.</p>
            <p>From CRT televisions to the latest embedded systems, I've always been driven to push technical limits while giving users a simple and convenient experience to enhance their stay.</p>

            <h2>Case Study - Samsung Lynk</h2>
            <p>Samsung's <a href="https://www.samsung.com/au/business/display-solutions/lynk-cloud/">Lynk Cloud</a> product is particularly enjoyable to work on, as its powerful page design platform allows for extra functionality to be added in javascript.  I take full advantage of this to add interactivity to my designs with scrolling and animations.</p>

            <h3>Marriott Group</h3>

            <p>As a well-established global brand, it was important to respect the Marriott Group's "GRE" style guide.  The Lynk system made it easy to adhere to this while adding in new features like animated navigation and interactive room service menus.</p>
            <h3>Rio Tinto Concept</h3>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GWatLN4wGtw?si=yH6wNKUlHz0FJmBZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>A design concept for use at remote worksites by FIFO workers.  I made use of Lynk's layer-based rendering to add a parallax effect to the screen background.  As the user scrolls across the options, the background layers move separately to give an impression of depth, and the sky slowly darkens.</p>
            <h3>Mercure Group</h3>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SJfgISBRGpI?si=YvnmY_9EjPTfExMy" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>I experimented with using simple text buttons instead of icons for this design, and I was really pleased with the smooth and clean-looking result.</p>
